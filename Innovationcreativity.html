                <div class="row_2">
                    <div class="col">

                        <h2>What is Innovation and Creativity Training</h2>
                        <p><b>Innovation</b> can be broadly thought of as new ideas, new ways of looking at things, new 
                            methods or products that have value. Innovation contains the idea of output, of 
                            actually producing or doing something differently, making something happen or 
                            implementing something new. Innovation almost always involves hard work; 
                            persistence and perseverance are necessary as many good ideas never get followed 
                            through and developed. </p>
                            <h4 class="llb">Frameworks to help you boost innovation in your organization</h4>
                            <p>there are many simple and effective ways companies can go about implementing change. In addition to design thinking, here are 5 popular approaches to innovation for you to learn about and try at your company:</p>
                               <ol class="ordered">
                                   <li>Agile(Scrum)</li>
                                        <p class="lbb">This approach to innovation makes room for collaborative teams to take charge of projects and develop strategies on how to achieve the desired outcome for them.
                                            Scrum also follows along with the idea of sprints, meaning that collaboration and design activity takes place in scheduled time blocks, usually between 2 weeks to a month long</p>

                                   <li>Lean Startup</li>
                                        <p class="lbb">The lean startup method is designed specifically for entrepreneurs, startups, or companies looking to develop new products or services. This approach begins and ends with the customer. By gaining insights from the perspective customer at the beginning of development,
                                             you can learn how to design and implement products and services that will fit their needs much quicker.</p>

                                   <li>Jobs to be Done</li>
                                         <p class="lbb"> This framework focuses on uncovering what “job” your product or service helps customers get done.
                                        To gain insight into your customer’s, 
                                        you need to stop focusing on the product and instead focus on the underlying reasons why the customer is using the product to begin with.
                                         </p>
                                   <li>User Experience</li>
                                          <p class="lbb">The User Experience (UX) approach is all about the end user. This approach heavily focuses on research and requires you to learn everything you can about your customers, organize that information, and develop design based on what you have learned.
                                               It involves putting your users at the center of everything you do.</p>
                                   <li>Design Sprints</li>
                                   <p class="lbb">The final framework on this list of approaches to innovation is the design sprint. A design sprint is a fast-paced way to generate ideas quickly and efficiently. Previously, we discussed design sprint training as well as ways a design sprint could support innovation in your organization. This approach can be highly productive when done correctly,
                                        as well as a good way to increase collaboration and develop a culture of innovation at your organization.</p>

                        <h2>Innovation and Creativity Training</h2>
                        <p>Creativity training may be the most important tool you and your organization has when it comes to staying competitive.
                             In a world that is getting smaller and smaller and changing faster and faster, innovation and creativity become keys to staying relevant.
                              Organizations and individuals who apply innovation move ahead.
                             Those who don’t, struggle and fall behind.
                           </p>
                           <h4 class="llb">The Need for Creativity and Innovation Training</h4>
                           <p>Most of us didn't learn innovation in school or the usual management training programs. We need a training experience that is lean, engaging, and impactful.
                                Many times they have a special innovation initiative, event, or program they need expertise in kicking off.</p>
                                <ul>
                                    <li>Respond to the rapid pace of change.</li>
                                    <li>Create, develop, & launch new products, services, or strategies</li>
                                    <li> Develop creativity & innovation skills and learn what you didn't in school</li>
                                    <li>Leverage and utilize new technologies instead of just getting disrupted by them</li>
                                </ul>
