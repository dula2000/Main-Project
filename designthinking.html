            <p>Design thinking is a human-centered, repetitive process of understanding the user, 
               challenging assumptions, and redefining problems.
               It consists of five basic stage: empathy, definition, idea, prototype and test.</p>
            <br><br><br>
            <img src="d4.jpg">
            <br><br><br>
            <p>Companies are increasingly recognizing the power of design thinking.
               But it naturally raises the question: How can you introduce this thinking into a new environment?</p>
            <br><br>
            
            <h4>Here are a few ways to champion design thinking in your organization:</h4>
            <br><br><br>
            <h1>1. Start small</h1>
            <p>Design thinking is not something you can magically imprint throughout your company. 
                It will take time to train others about the mindset first, then plan to implement
                each of the five stages.</p>
             
             <p>So start small first. Build small experiments that allow your team to practice 
                collecting data, checking frequently, and repeating quickly. By setting aside 
                time for those skills you will set your mindset.</p>
             <br><br><br>

            <h1>2. Identify previous adopters and evangelists</h1>
            <p>With the introduction of any new process or skill, there will always be people 
               who naturally excel from the start. Some people have previous experience in design 
               thinking or are particulary keen to take the time to learn about it.</p>

               <p>Be sure to use these great people to create a network of supporters. These 
                  individuals can act as evangelizers for design thinking, leading the concept 
                  in meetings and project across departments, and also helping to train other 
                  employees along the way.</p>
            <br><br><br>

            <h1>3. Avoid silos by department or team</h1>
            <p>Design thinking is multi-disciplinary and co-creative. It works best when it 
               involves people who bring different perspectives and expertise to the table.</p>

               <p>whether you are conducting a workshop to teach your organization about design 
                  thinking or starting a small project to gain practical experience, make sure 
                  your designteams include people across departments and disciplines.</p>
             <br><br><br>
             <img src="d2.jpg">
             <br><br><br>

            <h1>4. Understand that design thinking is a fluid process</h1>
            <p>Creative thinking is not linear. The five stages should not follow a specific
               sequence and can occur in parallel. When introducing disign thinking at an early 
               stage, do not try to apply the process from end to end, from empathy to examination 
               to every problem.</p>

               <p>Make sure you apply disign thinking in a way that is most meaningfull to your problem.
                  For example, you can start testing and find that it creates new ideas for your project.
               </p>
             <br><br><br>

            <h1>5. Identify how you will measure success</h1>
            <p>How do you measure and communicate th success of design thinking? When you spend a lot of
               time and effort introducing the process to your team, make sure you have a system in place
               to monitor progress. You can track the number of projects where design thinking is relevant.
               Or, conduct surveys to measure the impact of design thinking on employee satisfaction.</p>
             <br><br><br>

            <h1>Boost innovation with design thinking</h1>
            <p>Just like with any change, it will take time to fully embed design thinking into your organization.
               You will have to test new ways to engage and motivate your teammates, and iterate as time goes on.
               But with benefits like increased efficiency and collaboration, itâ€™s worth it.</p>
