              <h1>Welcome to the Innovations</h1>
              <p>Not so long ago, most technological innovation happened in well-funded corporate and university research labs because new technology was expensive and time-consuming. It required specialized knowledge and costly equipment for building custom components. Innovation was a secretive process involving research and proprietary intellectual property.
                   It took a long time to prove the feasibility of a new idea, and then there was the expense of bringing it to market.

                   <p>The word ‘Innovation’ literally means a new idea,
                    which is then transformed through various processes
                    into reality. The theme of this issue of Business
                    Lanka is ‘Innovation’, which focuses on the many
                    industries in Sri Lanka that are constantly innovating
                    to introduce novel products to the market.</p>

                           <p class="p1">Laparoscopic Knot Applicator is a tool designed to facilitate application of “surgeons Knot” (FIG. 2) to ligate vessels and structures during laparoscopic procedures.
                                Applying the secure surgeons knot in any surgical procedure is a life saving basic skill but it is a difficult task in laparoscopic surgeries. Operation of this tool (FIG. 3) ensures application of safer and secure knots compared to currently available techniques like clips, loops and Harmonic scalpel
                                . Simple design of this tools enables laparoscopic surgeon to apply very secure conventional “surgeons knot” easily during laparoscopic surgeries even in a very limited surgical space.
                                Cleaning and the sterilization of the instrument which is essential in surgical procedures is very easy as there are no electronic parts incorporated.</p>
